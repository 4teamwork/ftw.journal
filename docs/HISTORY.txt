0.2

* Implemented journaling mechanism using adapters and event handlers. There are
  two adapters to journalize something on a context, one for journalizing in
  the workflow history, and one for an annotations-based journal. Which one
  is used depends on which marker interface (see interfaces.py) the type
  implements. The annotations based system is not tested yet.

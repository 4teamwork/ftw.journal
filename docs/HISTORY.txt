* Implemented journaling mechanism using adapters and event handlers. There are two adapters to journalize something
  on a context, one for journalizing in the workflow history, and one for an annotations-based journal. Which one
  is used depends on which marker interface (see interfaces.py) the type implements. The annotations based system is
  not tested yet.
